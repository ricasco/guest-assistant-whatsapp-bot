# Guest Assistant WhatsApp Bot

## Overview
This project demonstrates a fully functional WhatsApp bot for the fictional "Giardino Tropicale" property, designed to provide guests with information about local amenities, emergency contacts, and personalized suggestions. Utilizing the Flask web framework and integrated with OpenAI's API, this application showcases advanced capabilities in natural language processing, data retrieval, and user interaction through WhatsApp.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Integration with OpenAI’s models to interpret and respond to user queries.
- **Dynamic Data Retrieval**: Uses Qdrant for efficient vector-based data storage and retrieval, enhancing the chatbot's ability to provide relevant information quickly.
- **Custom Response Handling**: Tailored responses based on user input, covering various topics like local dining, emergency services, and tourist attractions.
- **Interactive Messaging**: Supports text and interactive buttons on WhatsApp to improve user engagement.
- **Flask Application**: A robust backend built with Flask to manage webhooks and HTTP requests seamlessly.

## Technical Highlights

- **Flask Web Framework**: Utilized Flask to set up a web server that handles requests from WhatsApp, processes them, and sends responses back to users.
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Developed a system to authenticate, receive, and send messages via the WhatsApp API, enabling real-time user interaction.
- **OpenAI API Utilization**: Implemented calls to OpenAI's API to generate text embeddings and handle complex queries, demonstrating proficiency in working with AI and machine learning models.
- **Vector Storage with Qdrant**: Set up a vector database using Qdrant to store and retrieve large amounts of data efficiently, showcasing skills in optimizing backend storage solutions for performance.
- **Modular Coding**: Organized the code into multiple modules and used Python’s import functionality to manage complexities in a maintainable way.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Implemented comprehensive logging and error handling to ensure reliability and ease of maintenance.

## Potential Applications

The technologies and strategies employed in this project are not limited to hospitality management but can be adapted to various domains requiring automated interaction platforms, such as:

- **Customer Support Bots**: Providing first-line support via messaging platforms.
- **Personal Assistant Applications**: Managing schedules, responding to inquiries, and integrating with IoT devices at home or in the office.
